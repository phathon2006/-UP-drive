# UP Drive V2 automated test plan

## Scope

Core feature: a passenger creates and manages a ride request in the corrected
UP Drive repository: https://github.com/phathon2006/-UP-drive

The application supports Create, Read, and cancellation (a status update).
There is no ride-request Delete endpoint, so these four cases are not a full
CRUD suite.

## Cases

| ID | Action | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-01 | Create a ride request with valid places and coordinates | HTTP 201; the response contains the new ride ID and passenger ID |
| TC-02 | Read the ride created in TC-01 | HTTP 200; stored values match the created ride |
| TC-03 | Cancel that ride | HTTP 200; a subsequent read shows status cancelled |
| TC-04 | Try to create a ride without an origin | HTTP 400; no ride is created |

TC-01 through TC-03 use the same ride. TC-03 leaves the ride in a cancelled
state. If an earlier case fails, teardown attempts to cancel any ride created
by this run. Existing rides belonging to the account are left alone.

## Setup

1. Run npm install in this repository.
2. Copy .env.example to .env and set the project URL and API keys. Keep the
   secret key on the server only. .env is ignored by Git.
3. Set the email and password of a passenger account reserved for these tests.
4. Install test dependencies with python -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt.
5. Start the application with npm start.
6. In another terminal run npm run test:e2e.

The runner writes a JSON summary to test-results/ride-request-results.json.
The test-results/ directory is ignored by Git.

## Database note

The existing Supabase project was checked read-only for the columns used by
this version of the ride-request feature. Do not run supabase.sql against
that shared project as a setup step: it drops the existing application tables
before recreating them. Use that SQL only when deliberately initializing a
separate, empty database or after a planned backup and migration.
